UBUNTU

Following requirements are needed for compiling the source:

  sudo apt-get install cmake libglu1-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev 

You will also need the git version of sfml. You can install it by doing 
following:

  sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libglew1.5-dev libjpeg8-dev \
  libopenal-dev libsndfile1-dev libxrandr-dev

  git clone https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML.git
  cd SFML
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make
  sudo make install
 
To compile the project create a build dir, run cmake and make

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make

to run the engine a directory called "aoe2" with the Age of empires 2 + 
expansion (and patch) is needed in the build directory. This can later be 
changed if config files will be implemented.
