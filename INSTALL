Ubuntu:

Following requirements are needed for compiling the source:

  sudo apt-get install cmake libsfml-dev libglu1-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev 
 
To compile the project create a build dir, run cmake and make

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make

to run the engine a directory called "aoe2" with the Age of empires 2 +
expansion (and patch) is needed in the build directory. This can later
be changed if config files will be implemented.
