Freeaoe is a project aimed to write a free engine capable of running Age of Empires 2.

The project is still in early development, but you can load scenarios and move around and stuff.

Dependencies:
    - SFML
    - Modern C++ compiler

To build:
    - Clone with --recurse-submodules (e. g. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sandsmark/freeaoe.git`)
    - mkdir build && cd build
    - cmake .. && make
    - ./freeaoe --game-path=~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Games/Age\ of\ Empires\ II\ The\ Conquerors\ Expansion\ Trial/
    - Adjust the path above (it should work with both the full games and trial edition)
