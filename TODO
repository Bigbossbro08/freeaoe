- Important tasks (experimental implementation/engine prototype):

 * unit rendering
 * unit selecting
 * basic commando like moving units with animation
 * basic network support (multiplayer)
 * initial ui support

- Refactor code, proper engine design (during/after implementation of preceding tasks):

 * Improve resource system (use Textures as much as possible)
 * Improve map rendering (make terrain blending possible)
 * Components for units really necesarry?
 * remove old server/client/communication code
 * case insensitive file loading
 * boost::shared_ptr typedef? (is there a nicer solution)
 * consider boost vector math instead of sfml vectors
 * signal system (boost signals?)

- Release initial version (0.1)
